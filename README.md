If you want to help on this dev, say to me.

If you need help about compilation and packaging I have basic notions, ask me.

I'm not a senior programmer, nor junior. I program as a hobby. So I'm not following professional coding practises.

I know that my code is horrifying and not good implemented. With patience I'll go to cleaning and improving it. 

All experienced help are welcome.
